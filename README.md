# A-Simplified-Simulation-of-Evolution
This Tkinter application represents a strongly simplified simulation of the evolution of animals. The animals are represented by colored points on a canvas and have random attributes in a predetermined range. The animals are represented by points. It allows visualization of the effects of natural selection and the development of different species over a long period of time.
