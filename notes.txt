Notes:
- add radom numbers to make information fuzzy 
- define abstract class for behaviors and define each type of behavior with a new class
- Keep a list of objectives for creatures


Simple creature phases:
- orient --> towards food or wander 
- act --> eat if food in reach, sleep if satisfied, duplicate if eaten 2 foods
