TODOS
High prio:
- create a simple hunter-prey simulation:
1. hunter + prey = new hunter and kill prey
2. prey + prey = new prey
3. prey can survive from environment 

Primer sim:
- add radom numbers to make information fuzzy
- should there be relation between constants for sizes, energy cost, wandering offset, etc.?
- more ambiguity of traits
- think about other data to display
