TODOS
High prio:
- make world class more flexible so that it can be used by multiple models
 --> it should only know concepts shared by all models 
- create a simple hunter-prey simulation
1. hunter + prey = new hunter and kill prey
2. prey + prey = new prey
3. prey can survive from environment 

Primer sim:
- only increment age after 1 day
- add radom numbers to make information fuzzy
- should there be relation between constants for sizes, energy cost, wandering offset, etc.?
- more ambiguity of traits
- think about other data to display
